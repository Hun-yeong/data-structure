# Data Structure Final Project
## 2014130606 Noh Hun-yeong


### What data structure you chose and why

* This project needs Advanced Search, Advanced Delete, Graph Algorithms

* In order to  realize items in the list above, the program should show the Adjacency among users**(1)**, the connection between User ID and User name**(2)**, and the relationship between User and the contents of the Tweet**(3)**.

So which data structures are needed to represent each of them?

* **(1)** can be represented by Graph
* **(2)** can be represented by Depth First Search Algorithm and Dijkstra Algorithm.
* **(3)** can be represented by Hash Table.
### What is your expected performance
* Finding out top 5 trognly connected components 
* Finding out 5 shortest path 

### How would you improve the system in the future

* Using more efficient and neat method
